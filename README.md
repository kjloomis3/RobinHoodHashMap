# RobinHoodHashMap
This is an example program used in a Java-based data structures programming course which can be 
used to highlight  the following topics:
* Data Structures: hash sets/maps
* Generic (templated) collections
* Implementing a collection interface
* Iterators
* JUnit testing

This is a program that shows some common functionality of a HashSet and HashMap based upon the 
robinhood hashing technique. It contains the RobinHoodHashSet and RobinHoodHashMap classes
to illustrate a possible design with some same test cases for each.
